* to go in core, you need to be used everytime!
* tQuery is only an API change, no change in semantic
  * other functions
  * other default
  * same semantic
* a good api is
  * clear (clear for whom ?)
  * stable
  * well documented
* you must be able to easily go back and forth between three.js and tQuery.
* core has no require.js
  * dependancy between plugins handled by require.js
* tquery.js core depends only on the three.js
* the only global defined is tQuery
